# clck
clck is a command line application that mimics a physical clock in system, designed for remote workers needing to track their own hours. The goal of this application is to make it as simple and intuitive for a general user (like a real clock in system!) while still providing some more in depth features for those who wish to use them.

## NOTICE
clck is in a VERY early stage of development. You may come across it in a state where it seemingly does nothing at all! Have no fear, when this project is ready to be truly deployed I will be sure to provide much better documentation.
