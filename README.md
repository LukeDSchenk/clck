# clck
clck is a command line application that mimics a physical clock in system, designed for remote workers needing to track their own hours. The goal of this application is to make it as simple and intuitive for a general user (like a real clock!) while still providing some more in depth features for those who wish to use them. This project is in an early stage of development at the moment, so please feel free to share any feedback, suggestions, etc.
